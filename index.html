                Soon NEXUS will transition to a fully project-driven approach for sharing IT events and job opportunities. Instead of a series of standalone posts, you'll engage with content through immersive, step-by-step projects. However, let me emphasize: we are not changing our core offerings. All six core services will still include the same essential features. We are only enhancing the way we present additional content and opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                After years—years—of pondering how to best connect people with IT events and job opportunities, I had a breakthrough moment! It happened quite unexpectedly: I slipped, hit my head on the desk, and when I came to, I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes our platform possible: the NEXUS Connect!
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It came to me while I was out for a run. The revelation: our entire platform should focus on immersive projects. Instead of standalone posts, we'll present opportunities and events as integrated projects, each with their own seamless series of tasks. Each task provides just enough information to help you complete it. And if you need more guidance, hints are readily available.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

                <p class="quote">
                    The entire platform should be built around engaging projects.
                </p>

            <p>
                No more walls of explanatory text. No more isolated tasks. Just one task at a time, as you build up a comprehensive project. Over the course of completing numerous tasks, you develop projects and deepen your understanding of the IT landscape. There is no transition between learning and doing, because the learning itself is integrated into the projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because—hey—real-world projects naturally involve repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main design challenge is transforming what are currently detailed explanations and instructions into concise task descriptions. Each project will involve dozens of tasks like this. Users will be engaged in hands-on activities the entire time, rather than switching back and forth between "reading mode" and "doing mode".
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of a series of separate tasks, users will work within their project environment, completing one task after another, rapidly building up a project. Users will enter a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they engage with larger projects. They'll experience a sense of forward progress right from the start. NEXUS will offer a much smoother and more engaging experience.
